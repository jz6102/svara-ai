## 🏗️ Architecture & Folder Structure

The project is organized as a monorepo with separate directories for the `frontend` and `backend`, ensuring a clear separation of concerns.

### Backend Architecture

The backend follows a modular, three-tier architecture to promote maintainability and scalability, adhering to SOLID principles.

-   **Controllers:** Handle incoming HTTP requests and outgoing responses. They are responsible for the request/response cycle and input validation.
-   **Services:** Contain the core business logic. They are called by controllers and interact with the repository layer.
-   **Models:** Define the Mongoose schemas and data structures for the application (Users, Projects, Tasks).

/backend/src/
├── controllers/    # Handles HTTP requests and responses
├── services/       # Contains business logic
├── models/         # Mongoose schemas
├── routes/         # API route definitions
├── middlewares/    # Authentication middleware (JWT verification)
└── config/         # Database connection setup


### Frontend Architecture

The frontend uses Next.js 15's App Router for file-based routing and organization. Reusable components and a global context for authentication promote DRY principles.

/frontend/src/
├── app/            # Next.js App Router, pages, and layouts
├── components/     # Reusable React components (Buttons, Modals, Cards)
├── context/        # Global state management (AuthContext)
└── lib/            # Helper functions (API service wrapper)

## ⚙️ Setup and Installation (For Local Development)

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

-   Node.js (v18 or later)
-   npm or yarn
-   A free MongoDB Atlas account

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/svara-ai-assignment.git
cd svara-ai-assignment
```

### 2. Setup the Backend

```bash
# Navigate to the backend directory
cd backend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Create a .env file in the /backend root and add your variables
# (See the Environment Variables section below)

# Start the server
npm start
```

The backend server will be running on http://localhost:5001.

### 3. Setup the Frontend

```bash
# Open a new terminal and navigate to the frontend directory
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

The frontend application will be available at http://localhost:3000.

### 🔒 Environment Variables
For the backend to connect to the database and manage authentication, you need to create a .env file in the /backend directory with the following variables:

```env
# Your MongoDB connection string from Atlas
MONGO_URI="mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.xxxxx.mongodb.net/yourDatabaseName?retryWrites=true&w=majority"

# A long, random, and secret string for signing JWTs
JWT_SECRET="your_super_secret_jwt_key"
```

### 🔌 API Endpoints
The backend provides the following RESTful API endpoints:

| Method | Endpoint | Protected | Description |
| ------ | -------- | --------- | ----------- |
| POST | /api/auth/signup | No | Register a new user. |
| POST | /api/auth/login | No | Log in a user and get a token. |
| POST | /api/projects | Yes | Create a new project. |
| GET | /api/projects | Yes | Get all projects for the user. |
| DELETE | /api/projects/:id | Yes | Delete a project. |
| POST | /api/tasks | Yes | Create a new task. |
| GET | /api/tasks/project/:id | Yes | Get all tasks for a project. |
| PUT | /api/tasks/:id | Yes | Update a task (e.g., status). |
| DELETE | /api/tasks/:id | Yes | Delete a task. |
